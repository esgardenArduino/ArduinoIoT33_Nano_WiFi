A basic project to connect your Arduino IoT 33 Nano WiFiNINA to the internet. The template is set up to send data obtained from several sensors to a Google Firebase real-time database. It is an example for school and urban gardens. It is a generic template that must be adapted.

Included files:
1.	*.ino includes functions to read your sensors and build a JSON structure.
2.	send_firebase is a template that uses WiFiNINA and Firebase_Arduino_WiFiNINA libraries.
3.	send_params describes your garden: name, spaces, sensors, etc.
4.	sensor_functions must be adapted with your reading and writing functions.
